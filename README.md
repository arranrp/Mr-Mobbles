# Kirby Knowledge Base

Kirby is a simple file-based cms, made by <https://twitter.com/bastianallgeier>. At <http://www.6wunderkinder.com> we're using it as an internal knowledge-base for any type of documentation (processes, products, API...). It took us a long time to find the best setup for this and because we think most companies are struggling with this, we decided to open-source it.

## Features

* Markdown Formatting
* Syntax Highlighting
* Search

## How to install?

Installing this is super simple!

1. Download and install Kirby (<https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms/zipball/master>)
2. Download and install the Kirby knowledge-base (<https://github.com/christianreber/kirbycms-knowledge-base/zipball/master>)
3. Create your own structure in the *content* folder! We've kept our's for the sake of demonstration, just delete what you don't need.
4. ***Hint:*** We highly recommend to use Kirby with Dropbox (<http://getkirby.com/blog/kirby-meets-dropbox> - locally and on your server) and to share the *content* folder with everyone in the team to make editing content extremely simple.

## What we've used to create the knowledge-base

* We've rewritten the treemenu snippet to create a simple and clean menu (<https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/snippets/treemenu)
* We've used the breadcrumb snippet (<https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/snippets/breadcrumb>)
* We've used the search plugin (<https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/search>)
* We've used the syntax highlighting plugin (link: https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-extensions/tree/master/plugins/highlight>)
* We created this simple theme (and got inspired from <https://developers.facebook.com/docs>)
